> ‚ÄúSesungguhnya diterima amal perbuatan itu bergantung pada niatnya, dan sesungguhnya bagi setiap orang akan mendapat apa yang diniatkannya. Sesiapa yang berhijrah kerana Allah dan Rasul-Nya, dia akan sampai kepada Allah dan Rasul-Nya. Sesiapa yang berhijrah menuju dunia yang akan diperolehnya atau menuju wanita yang hendak dinikahinya, dia akan mendapatkan apa yang diniatkannya.‚Äù

## üìùSynopsis 
We offer a project that will oversee the hajj and umrah system to make it run more smoothly and flawlessly. Our system offers a wide range of options, including those concerning pilgrims' health, visa approval, tour package selection, Hajj and Umrah package selection, and room size. In order to facilitate users' ability to perform prayer during the later Hajj and Umrah seasons, all of these alternatives are available. We also supply pilgrims who want to see fascinating historical sites travel packages at reasonable, dependable rates. This method intends to provide the public with the most convenient Umrah and Hajj worship packages while also making it easier for administrators to oversee pilgrims in terms of tourism, embassy relations, and health care.


## üéØObjectives 
The purpose of the Umrah Hajj system is to make the physical package purchase procedure easier. Users of this system are limited to selecting the desired package online, along with a few supplementary features that encourage them to use the system. The following are the objectives of the proposed system.
1) allowing any individual to complete the Hajj and Umrah, while also raising the congregation's degree of faith and making sure participants are aware of both the practical and spiritual aspects of these pilgrimages.
2) providing pilgrims with aid in organizing their Hajj and Umrah, including help with travel, lodging, health, required documentation, and creating a clear schedule to ensure a hassle-free, well-planned experience.
3) providing pilgrims with assistance regarding the Hajj and Umrah procedures through seminars designed to meet their religious and emotional needs.
4) allowing the audience to experience learning about and getting to know the local culture while also highlighting the significance of the Hajj and Umrah to deepen their understanding of this act of worship.


## üîçScope 
1) Users can choose the Hajj/Umrah packages to choose from, update their personal information, and decide whether or not to travel.
2) This approach assigns a doctor to each congregation, enables the administrator to determine what ailment the pilgrims are facing, what medication is required, and if the pilgrims may resume worship or not.
3) Inform the congregation if their visa has been approved or denied, advising them to reapply to avoid any issues during immigration.
4) This program shows five different worship sites based on the date that has been established, along with an alluring tour package that can be chosen once the congregation has concluded their time in worship.
5) allowing the congregation to select the kind of accommodation that best suits their needs at a fair price
