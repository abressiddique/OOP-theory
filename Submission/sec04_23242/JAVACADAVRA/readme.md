#### 1. Classes and Object

Class
  -  Blueprint that describes the structure and behavior shared by all objects of a specific  kind.
  -  For this management system, we already decided to use 9 classes which consist of class Person,Coach,Manager,Athletes,Team,TrainingSession,Event,Sport and also SportsTeamManagement (main method).
  -  Each class consists of their own attribute and method.
	
Object
- Instances of classes created during runtime.
- Each object has its own attributes and can perform methods defined in its class.

#### 2. Constructor
- Special kind of methods for creating instance of the class
- Each class that we created have one constructor
- Constructor are called when keyword ‘new’ is used to create object.
