# Sports Team Manager - Project

## Overview of The Project <a name="overview"></a> :heavy_check_mark:

## Synopsis <a name="synopsis"></a> ‚ú®
The Sports Team Manager allows users to store data about sports management including the athletes, coach, manager, training session, sports, and events in a more organized way. For instance, we can view, add and remove the athlete‚Äôs details, teams, team‚Äôs member and the events of the sport and also their training. First of all, the system will prompt the user to insert the number that is provided in the system (1-3) which will manage the athlete, manage the team, and exit the system. The system will prompt the user to either want to use the existing athlete/team data or want to add a new athlete/team. Next the user will be given 8 options to manage the athlete and team which are to recruit an athlete into the team, remove an athlete from the team, add a training session, remove a training session, add a sports event, cancel a sports event, display team details and exit the athlete/team management menu. All of the options have two options inside them which are either want to use the existing data or add new data except for canceling a sports event, remove an athlete from the team, remove a training session and exit option. 


## Objective and Scope <a name="objective"></a> üß†
The aim is to apply for a sports team manager based on what we learned in the Object-Oriented Programming which are encapsulation, association, aggregation, composition, inheritance, polymorphism and exception handling. The program provides a menu- driven interface for performing some operations similar as adding, deleting, and viewing  athletes, training, events, members of the team to the system, for a based on provided options, and displaying the updated data. In this coding we use the arraylist for our program as it should be able to handle increments of data volume efficiently. First of foremost, we definitely implemented encapsulation and hiding concepts in our system of each class as it was the basic concept in Object Oriented. Aggregation and composition also have been implemented in our coding for the management of the team class(aggregation), athlete class(aggregation)  and event class(composition). While inheritance was implemented at coach class, athlete class and manager class that inherit the data from the person class. For the association we use unidirectional and bidirectional concepts so that the object‚Äôs class can call the methods in other objects. For the polymorphism, we also implemented in the Person class, Coach class and Manager class that have the same method but different behaviour or action. Furthermore, our system has exception handling to prevent the program crashing, as if we don‚Äôt have this process, exceptions will disrupt our process in the system. The system also has a user-friendly interface with a menu- driven system that determines users through the whole process until they choose to exit the system.

## Workflow <a name="workflow"></a> 

 
## OO Concepts <a name="ooconcepts"></a> ‚úçüèº
#### 1. Classes and Object

Class
  -  Blueprint that describes the structure and behavior shared by all objects of a specific  kind.
  -  For this management system, we already decided to use 9 classes which consist of class Person,Coach,Manager,Athletes,Team,TrainingSession,Event,Sport and also SportsTeamManagement (main method).
  -  Each class consists of their own attribute and method.
	
Object
- Instances of classes created during runtime.
- Each object has its own attributes and can perform methods defined in its class.

#### 2. Constructor
- Special kind of methods for creating instance of the class
- Each class that we created have one constructor
- Constructor are called when keyword ‚Äònew‚Äô is used to create object.

#### 3. Encapsulation and Data Hiding
- For data hiding using encapsulation, we declared each attribute in each class  as  private.
- This will prevent direct access to the attribute hence ensuring the data integrity.
- To access this attribute we need to use an accessor or also known as getter (ex: getName() in ‚ÄòPerson‚Äô class).

#### 4. Association
- Represent general binary relationships that describe an activity between two classes.
- We implement both unidirectional(one-way) and bidirectional navigability.
- By using association, it allows objects to call methods in other objects. As an example, addTrainingSession(TrainingSession) method can be called in ‚ÄòCoach‚Äô.
- It enables one class to gain information about another and interact with its objects.

#### 5. Composition
- Composition is a strong form of aggregation.
- The parts (object of another class) belong to one whole class and does not change during the execution. [Strong Ownership].
- As an example, ‚ÄòAthlete‚Äô class needs at least one ‚ÄòSport‚Äô object. An ‚ÄòAthlete‚Äô cannot exist without being associated with a ‚ÄòSport‚Äô.

#### 6. Aggregation
- Aggregation is a special form of association, ‚Äúhas-a‚Äù relationship.
- Relationship where one whole class contains parts (objects of another class). [Weak Ownership]
- As an example, ‚ÄòAthlete‚Äô class does not necessarily need to have a ‚ÄòManager‚Äô object. It still can execute even if the ‚ÄòAthlete‚Äô does not have a ‚ÄòManager‚Äô.
- Allows part objects to exist independently of the whole object.

#### 7. Inheritance 
- Inheritance implements the ‚Äúis-a‚Äù relationship that consists of superclass(general class) and subclass(specialized class).
- Process which a new class is created from anothe class.
- Allow subclass to inherits the attributes and methods of the superclass.
- As an example, ‚ÄòPerson‚Äô is a superclass that allow other classes such as ‚ÄòCoach‚Äô, ‚ÄòManager‚Äô and ‚ÄòAthlete‚Äô to inherit all the attributes and methods.

#### 8. Polymorphism 
- Polymorphism  is when the same method call can lead to different behaviors.
- Allows methods to be overridden.
- Polymorphism also uses dynamic binding that determines the method to be invoked during runtime based on the object type not the reference type.
- ‚ÄògetInfo()‚Äô method can lead to different behaviors depending on which it is invoked. As an example, if it is called by object ‚ÄòCoach‚Äô, it will return name, gender, age, experience and expertise. Meanwhile, if it is called by object ‚ÄòManager‚Äô, it will return name, gender, age and office.

#### 9. Exception Handling
- For exception handling, we decided to use a do‚Ä¶while loop.
- The user will be ask to enter choice 1-3 (Manage Athlete(s), Manage Team(s) and Exit) only, if the user enter any other number, the system will keep looping until the correct input is entered.

- The figure above illustrates the overview flow of the flowchart which incorporates multiple layers of data handling, loop, conditional statements and others.

- Figure above illustrates the flow of athlete management option flow, after each option is executed the program will return to the athlete menu display via loop. The options offered for athlete management menu are recruitment and removal of the athlete from a team, joining and canceling a training session, joining and canceling a sport event and displaying athletes details.

- Figure above illustrates the flow of team management option flow, after each option is executed the program will return to the team menu display via loop. Similar to athlete management flow, the options offered for team management menu are recruitment and removal of the athlete from a team, joining and canceling a training session, joining and canceling a sport event and displaying team details. The program also offers an option to exit the program.

- Lastly, the figure above illustrates the class diagram of the sports team management program. It consists of multiple classes such as Person, Coach, Manager, Athlete, Team, TrainingSession, Sport, Event and SportsTeamManagement. This program employs multiple relationships such as association, aggregation and composition. Each class also employs various private attributes and public methods and constructors.
